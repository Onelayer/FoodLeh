# FoodLeh

1. Functionalities

Our website consists of two components, the interface for the customer side and the interface for the hawker side.

a) For the customer side, there will be user interface with a front page which will contain buttons to access different hawker centres. Each hawker centre will have its own page, where it will contain hawker stores. Customers can then choose the store they want, and enter the page. Here, they can order using the menu and make choices such as the size of the food and add these food to the cart. When they are ready to checkout, they can go over the the checkout page and checkout. A receipt will be generated and give them an estimated time for them to collect their food from the store. The order data will be written in firebase realtime database.

b) For the hawker side, there will be a login page where they can register for an account using the register page before login in. After login in, they will be able to access the dashboard. Here, orders from the realtime database is read here for the hawker to see their customer's orders. The hawker can then get the food ready for the customer. There will be a tick box for the customer to tick after they have collected the payment and passed over the food. Orders are cleared daily.
