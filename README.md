# FoodLeh

1. Functionalities

Our website will consist of a front page, with buttons to access different hawker centres. Each hawker centre will have its own page, where it will contain hawker stores. Customers can then choose the store they want, and enter the page. Here, they can order using the menu and make choices such as the size of the food and add these food to the cart. When they are ready to checkout, they can go over the the checkout page and checkout. A receipt will be generated and give them an estimated time for them to collect their food from the store.

When their order is submitted, the data is stored in the firebase realtime database and the data will be fetched and shown on the dashboard of the hawker account. The hawker can then get the food ready for the customer. There will be a tick box for the customer to tick after they have collected the payment and passed over the food. Orders are cleared daily.
